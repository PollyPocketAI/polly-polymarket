## 🔬 Markets Researched in Depth

---

### 1. Will the Colorado Avalanche win the 2026 NHL Stanley Cup?

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market YES price | 22.6% |
| Polly YES estimate | 23-24% |
| Edge | +0.4% to +1.4% |
| Confidence | 72% |
| **Verdict** | **PASS** |

**Research sources:**
- ESPN NHL Standings (live)
- VegasInsider Stanley Cup futures (updated Feb 19, 2026)

**Data:**
- Avalanche record: 37-9-9, 83 pts — #1 in the NHL by wide margin
- Goal differential: +74 (league best)
- Sportsbook implied probabilities:
  - Bet365 +300 → 25.0%
  - BetMGM +225 → 30.8%
  - DraftKings +350 → 22.2%
  - Caesars +400 → 20.0%
  - FanDuel +210 → 32.3%
  - HardRock +275 → 26.7%
  - RiversCasino +240 → 29.4%
  - Sportsbook average raw implied: ~26.6%
  - After ~15% vig discount: ~22.6%

**Reasoning:** Polymarket at 22.55% is essentially exactly what the sportsbook consensus implies after removing overround. The Avalanche are the clear #1 team by every metric, and that's priced in. Even being the dominant favorite in a 32-team league only gets you to ~22-25% cup odds — playoff hockey is chaotic. No edge here.

**Key risks to YES:** Injury to Nathan MacKinnon, first-round exit (happens to dominanat regular season teams), playoff format randomness.

### 2. GTA VI released before June 2026?

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market YES price | 3.45% |
| Polly YES estimate | 5-8% |
| Edge | +1.5% to +4.5% |
| Confidence | 45% |
| **Verdict** | **PASS** — insufficient confidence |

**Reasoning:**
- As of Feb 24, 2026: GTA VI has not been released (market is still active)
- Rockstar has no confirmed specific release date for spring 2026
- Rockstar is notorious for delays (Red Dead Redemption 2 slipped multiple times)
- With ~95 days to May 31 and no confirmed date: the crowd's 3.45% seems like it might be slightly low (my estimate is 5-8%), but I have LOW confidence because:
  - I can't access current news without a web search API
  - Release timeline knowledge post my training cutoff is limited
- Not betting without higher confidence, despite potential slight underpricing

### 3. Will GTA 6 cost $100+? (Resolves Feb 28, 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market YES price | 0.45% |
| Polly YES estimate | ~0.3% |
| Edge | -0.15% |
| Confidence | 85% |
| **Verdict** | **PASS** — no meaningful edge, market is essentially priced correctly |

**Reasoning:**
- Game has not been released as of Feb 24 — only 4 days to resolution
- Market resolves NO if game is not released by Feb 28
- Combined probability of (game releases by Feb 28) × (price ≥ $100) is negligible
- Market's 0.45% accounts correctly for tail risk; if anything could bet NO but risk/reward is poor

| Market | Price | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|

| AOC 2028 President | 7% YES | Combination of nom + general, roughly fair |
| Argentina 2026 WC | 13% YES | Defending champ, would need data |
| France 2026 WC | 10% YES | Strong team, need current odds |
| 2028 Dem nom markets overall | 1-4% each | Speculative, many candidates |

## 🔑 Key Finding: Research Bottleneck

**Without a Brave Search API key, my research capability is severely limited.** I can only fetch URLs I already know, which makes it hard to:
- Find breaking news that moves markets
- Research unfamiliar markets efficiently
- Identify informational asymmetries quickly

**Recommendation:** Get a Brave Search API key (free tier available) and configure it in OpenClaw. This would 10x my research throughput.

## Next Scan

Will run again in ~4 hours. Monitoring:
- Sports markets: NHL, NBA, soccer (World Cup odds)
- Near-term resolvable markets (expiring within 30 days)
- Any market with unusually high 24h volume spike (often indicates news not yet priced)
